# Linear Algebra project

This project was developed as part of an assessment in MSc Applied Computational Science at Imperial.
It implements gaussian elimination and finding the determinant of a matrix. Part of the assessment was developing code using proper software development practices, such as including tests, documentation and continuous integration (CI) using Github actions.


The package `acse_la` is installed by running
```bash
pip install -e .
```
from within the base folder of this repository.
